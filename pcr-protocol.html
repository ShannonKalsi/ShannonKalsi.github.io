    <h1>PCR Protocol</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful technique used to amplify a single copy of a target DNA sequence into millions of copies. This protocol covers the basics of PCR, including real-time and endpoint PCR methods. It is crucial to understand your experimentâ€™s requirements before beginning, so refer to relevant literature for specific protocols.</p>

    <h2>Acronyms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RT-PCR</strong>: Reverse Transcription PCR</li>
        <li><strong>qPCR</strong>: Quantitative PCR (also referred to as Real-Time PCR)</li>
        <li><strong>End point PCR</strong>: A PCR method where the product is analyzed at the end of the reaction.</li>
        <li><strong>SYBR Green</strong> & <strong>TaqMan</strong>: Two primary chemistries for real-time PCR.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-Time PCR vs End Point PCR</h2>
    <p>Real-Time PCR measures the amplification as it occurs, focusing on the exponential growth phase. This is ideal for quantification of gene expression. In contrast, End Point PCR only evaluates the amount of PCR product at the end, often visualized on a gel electrophoresis.</p>

    <h3>Real-Time PCR</h3>
    <p>Real-Time PCR focuses on the exponential phase of PCR for precise quantification. The fluorescence signal generated is proportional to the amount of PCR product, allowing for quantification.</p>

    <h3>SYBR Green vs TaqMan Chemistry</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SYBR Green:</strong> A dye that binds to double-stranded DNA. Requires manual validation of primers and a melt curve analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>TaqMan:</strong> Uses a fluorogenic probe for target detection. More specific but more costly due to pre-designed probes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Calculation Methods</h2>
    <h3>Relative Quantification</h3>
    <p>The two main methods for relative quantification in PCR are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SYBR Green (Relative Standard Curve):</strong> Uses a standard curve to determine relative quantities of the target gene.</li>
        <li><strong>TaqMan (Comparative Ct Method):</strong> Compares the Ct values of samples relative to a reference sample to determine relative gene expression.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Components of a Real-Time PCR Experiment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sample:</strong> The target or gene of interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Reference Sample:</strong> A sample used for comparison (often untreated control).</li>
        <li><strong>Endogenous Control:</strong> A gene that is expected to have stable expression in all samples.</li>
        <li><strong>Replicates:</strong> Multiple identical reactions to ensure accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Negative Controls:</strong> Samples containing no template to check for contamination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Consumables</h2>
    <p>Use only Fast consumables for PCR experiments, such as reaction plates, tube strips, and tubes, for optimal results.</p>
