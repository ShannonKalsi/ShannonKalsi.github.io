                <h3>Passage of Cells</h3>
                <p>Follow these steps to passage cells:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Before starting any work in the tissue culture hood, switch it on and allow the flow to stabilize for 10 minutes. Check inside the hood and if possible underneath the working area to make sure that it is clean and swab down with 70% alcohol solution.</li>
                    <li>Spray everything to be placed inside the hood thoroughly with 70% IMS (Industrial methylated spirits) solution and try to keep clutter in the hood to a minimum.</li>
                    <li>Remove growth medium from the cell monolayer and discard (normally into a waste beaker in the hood containing Virkon solution. Leave for 24h before discarding down the sink).</li>
                    <li>Wash the cell monolayer (x2) with PBS, removing as much excess liquid from the flask as possible.</li>
                    <li>Add Trypsin 1x solution (2mls/T-75) and ensure even coverage of cells by rocking, place in an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for approximately 5 minutes. After this time gently tap the side of the vessel and the cell should have completely detached from the flask surface.</li>
                    <li>Add growth medium (~8mls) to the flask and combine with the trypsinized cell solution to neutralize the enzyme activity, transfer to a sterile centrifuge tube and pellet cells at 1200rpm for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in an appropriate volume of growth medium before distributing to new tissue culture flasks. Add sufficient growth medium to the flask to maintain cell growth (~10mls/T-75).</li>
                    <li>Carefully label the cells and take care to make note of the change in passage number.</li>
                    <li>Monitor cell growth and passage when ~80% confluent. Do not allow cells to become overconfluent and destroy any cells whose morphological appearance appears altered.</li>
                    <li>Dispose of treated waste down the sink with plenty of running water.</li>
                    <li>Clean down hood thoroughly with alcohol solution and remove all material.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Culturing Cells from Frozen Stocks</h3>
                <p>Follow these steps for culturing cells from frozen stocks:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Defrost cryovial containing cells rapidly and transfer contents to a centrifuge tube.</li>
                    <li>Add growth medium (9mls) and centrifuge at 1200rpm for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in an appropriate amount of growth medium (5mls/T-25) before transferring to a small tissue culture flask.</li>
                    <li>Incubate 37°C, 5% CO2 for 4 hours then check the cells for viability. At this stage the majority of cells should have stuck, sometimes this is accompanied by a lot of debris and in this case the medium should be refreshed.</li>
                    <li>Continue to monitor cell growth and passage into a larger flask when ~80% confluent.</li>
                </ol>

            <!-- Freezing Down Cells Protocol -->
            <section class="protocol">
                <h3>Freezing Down Cells</h3>
                <p>Follow these steps to freeze down cells:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pellet cells using normal passaging procedure (steps 1-4).</li>
                    <li>Make up freeze-down solution of DMSO (1ml) and Fetal calf serum (2mls) and 7ml of media.</li>
                    <li>Add freeze-down solution (5mls) to each pellet and resuspend thoroughly before transferring 1ml aliquots to labelled cryovials.</li>
                    <li>Make sure each cryovial is clearly labelled with the name of the cell line, passage number, researcher name and date.</li>
                    <li>Store at -20°C overnight before transferring to -80°C and/or liquid nitrogen dewar.</li>
                    <li>Ideally use ‘Mr Frosty’ which is a special container for freezing-down cells. It contains an outer core of Propan-2-ol which cools the cells from room temperature by 1°C/minute and reduces ice crystal formation and therefore results in greater cell recovery. Once encased in this container cells can be placed straight into the -80°C freezer. The propan-2-ol must be replaced after every 5th use.</li>
